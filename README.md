# Brawl stars eSports bot

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

You can probably use node too but I haven't tried it yet.

To get the bot working, just open the powershell or bash script depending on which side of the universe you belong to.

1. To get a discord token, follow any tutorial online - there are hundreds.
2. Paste the bot's ID as client id and the guild you want the bot to be in as your Guild id.
3. To get a liquipedia token, go to their discord server, see #api-help, and fill the form on the first pinned message. Wait for them to accept and then enter your API key here.


Finally, register the commands to your server using

```bash
bun register
```
